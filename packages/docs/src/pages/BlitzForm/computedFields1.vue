/**
Computed fields are fields that can represent data which doesn't neccesarily exist in your data. They have a "caluculated value" based on the form data.

Do not confuse this concept with "Evaluated Props".
- Evaluated Props: a calculated prop of a field
- Computed Fields: a field with a calculated value

An example of a Computed Field could be a full name of a person which exists of `${formData.firstName} ${formData.lastName}`

There are three ways we could create such a field:

## The `parseValue` prop

```js
{
  id: 'fullName',
  component: 'QInput', // or any other component
  parseValue: (val, {formData}) => `${formData.firstName || ''} ${formData.lastName || ''}`
}
```

So even though the field `fullName` has no `value` at all, it will always stay in sync with the current `formData`.

When implementing a computed field this way however, `fullName` will never have that computed value emitted. This means that it won't be included in the BlitzForm events: `@input`, `@field-input` and `@save`. So it's difficult to capture and save this calculated value alongside your other data. See the next tab for another method.
