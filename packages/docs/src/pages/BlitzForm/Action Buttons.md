# Action Buttons

Action buttons are buttons you would want to add to a form to do things like edit/save/delete etc... You can easily add action buttons like these on the top/bottom or sides of your BlitzForm.

Action buttons are set via the prop 'actionButtons'. You can use pre-made action buttons that emit events. You can also overwrite the look of these pre-made buttons. Finally you can also set custom buttons and fields.
