# Basics

In some cases you might need a form that's actually a "list" users can fill in. Eg. Have a form where a teacher can write down names of students in a list.

For this I prepared a special kind of form called a **BlitzListForm** that offers these features:

- Auto populates the next empty field whenever there is user input
- Can be used as standalone component or inside a BlitzForm as a field
- Saves the data as an array
