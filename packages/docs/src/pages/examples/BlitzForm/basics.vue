/**
`&#60;EasyForm /&#62;` is a component that allows you to easily create forms by passing an object with a schema on how you want the form to look. By merely passing a schema array you can easily generate entire forms! No more writing clunky HTML forms! ðŸŽ‰

## Schema

The schema of an EasyForm is an array of objects that usually looks something like this:
Eg.:
```js
[
  // you can use custom Vue components
  { id: 'myField', label: 'My Field', component: 'MyFieldVueComponent' },

  // you can use quasar components
  { id: 'name', label: 'Name', component: 'QInput' },
]
```

Besides 'id', 'label' and 'component' there are many more props you can pass: subLabel; required; labelPosition; fieldClasses; componentClasses; parseValue; parseInput; events and many more.

## Value/Model

There are several ways to work with the data of an EasyForm.

1. You can pass an empty object as `v-model` (or `:value` & listen to `@input`).<br />In this case EasyForms will populate an object with the field's `id` as key and the user input as value.
2. You can listen to the `@field-input` event which triggers every time a field's value changes. It's payload is an object that looks like: `{id, value}`.
3. You can listen to the `@save` event which is triggered when the form's save button is pressed. It's payload is an object that looks like: `{newData, oldData}`. For more info see the [Action Buttons documentation](/actionButtons).
